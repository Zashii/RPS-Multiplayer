This is a Rock Paper Scissors game that you can play online with another player!

Once both player slots have been filled, extra players can still join in to spectate and chat.

As just mentioned, there is a chat window at the bottom for players to communicate with each other.

The game is quite self-explanatory. You cannot see the opponent's move until both players have made their move.
